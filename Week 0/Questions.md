2.Write a Java programme which reads two integers, two float values and two string data ("123", "999") from the terminal and then passes these values through an add() operation one by one.  Display the final result. 

Hints :   

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(new File("myNumbers"));   
        while (sc.hasNextLong()) {    
            long aLong = sc.nextLong();    
        }    
        sc.close();
